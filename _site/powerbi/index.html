        <p>
          The company can assess the effectiveness of product-driven marketing
          campaigns by analyzing sales and profit metrics for each product. This
          insight helps refine strategies to optimize revenue and profit.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Data Insights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Top Products: Bike accessories like tire tubes, patch kits, helmets, and water bottles drive strong revenue. Mountain tire tubes see increased sales during peak riding seasons in the U.S. due to off-road biking trends, highlighting the need for inventory adjustments.</li>
          <li>Profitability vs. Adjusted Profit: The profitability analysis compares actual profit to adjusted profit, considering factors like discounts and bulk pricing. For example, a 10% discount can boost orders by 7% and increase profit margins by 3%, ensuring sustained profitability.</li>
          <li>Performance Over Plan: The performance over plan graph tracks sales against forecasts to identify gaps. For instance, road tires underperformed seasonally, so a promotion targeting corporate wellness initiatives was introduced to boost off-peak sales.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Target High-Performing Products: Focus marketing on top sellers like sports helmets and water bottles during peak sales periods (e.g., biking season, holidays).</li>
          <li>Optimize Discount Strategies: Use data to find discount levels that increase sales without harming profit margins, favoring moderate discounts (e.g., 10%) over steep ones.</li>
          <li>Leverage Bundling Smartly: Bundle complementary products (e.g., A set of mountain tire tubes with a pump) to increase average order value.</li>
          <li>Adjust Campaigns for Underperforming Products: For underperforming items like basic bike locks and bike bells, launch targeted campaigns in specific markets (e.g., bike rentals, tour operators) to better match demand.</li>
